Until now I've been relying on generous feedback from users who go out of their way to share their tips or tribulations. So I've written a short survey that should offer a streamline process for users to voice their views on Rakaly. I would be very thankful if you completed it.

<!--truncate-->

There are a few of goals of the survey:

 - Confirm if users like the current feature set
 - Are users here mostly for single player or multiplayer saves
 - What future features users want implemented

There's a couple ancillary questions but those are the gist.

I'll let the survey continue until there are enough responses, so tenatively that means a few weeks
